\keywords{Resource allocation, performance monitoring}

\begin{abstract}
In a cloud environment monitoring applications should be able to scale in order to satisfy the monitoring requirements offering good quality of service and efficient resource utilization. In order for this scaling to be possible, monitoring applications should be built from the ground up with this goal in mind and mechanism for auto scaling should be implemented in order to provide a fast adaptation time. This report describes the work that has been done in order to enhance a monitoring system with automatic resource allocation capabilities. The work describes possible architectures with their advantages and drawbacks and implementations with their technical challenges.
