\section*{Conclusions}
This report presents the work done in order to enhance the system and bring it one step closer to the main objective of dynamic allocation of components on virtual machines. Constant change in resource utilization of each component must be taken into account in order to predict the VM where to allocate a component and continuous performance monitoring must be implemented in order to record the change in resource utilization of each component. The next step is to build a component that is able to use the performance metrics gathered and make allocation plans.
